# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a new chat interface module that provides conversational capabilities with integrated memory access and optional sequential thinking functionality. The interface will mimic synthesis tools by allowing users to engage in contextual conversations while leveraging stored knowledge and structured thinking processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a SYNTH that operates with proper identity context (client_user_id, actor_type=synth, actor_id), so that the SYNTH can access the correct memory graph and operate within the appropriate authority boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message with client_user_id THEN the system SHALL use this for billing and client context identification
2. WHEN actor_type=synth and actor_id are provided THEN the system SHALL determine the specific SYNTH being impersonated and its accessible memory graph
3. WHEN the SYNTH's synth_class is identified THEN the system SHALL load its core education and baseline functionality
4. WHEN specializations exist for the SYNTH THEN the system SHALL extend or override the synth_class capabilities
5. WHEN client memory graph conflicts with synth_class THEN the client's memory graph SHALL take final authority
6. WHEN a SYNTH manager provides additional instructions THEN the system SHALL allow memory updates and synth_class overrides

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to enable sequential thinking mode, so that I can get more structured and deliberate responses for complex queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables sequential thinking mode THEN the system SHALL use the sequential thinking service for response generation
2. WHEN sequential thinking is disabled THEN the system SHALL use standard response generation
3. WHEN sequential thinking mode is active THEN the system SHALL display thinking steps to the user
4. WHEN sequential thinking fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to standard response generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want conversation context to be maintained during the session and then consolidated into the memory system, so that the memory neural network continues to evolve with new knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain context in memory for the duration of the session
2. WHEN conversation context needs consolidation THEN the system SHALL trigger the memory_maker_crew asynchronously
3. WHEN context is sent to memory_maker_crew THEN it SHALL include client_user_id, actor_type, and actor_id
4. WHEN memory consolidation completes THEN the system SHALL UPSERT the processed memories via the memory API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to be accessible via REST API with proper context isolation, so that it can handle thousands of concurrent conversations across multiple clients while maintaining individual conversation context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes a POST request to /chat THEN the system SHALL process the message and return a response with proper context isolation
2. WHEN 10,000+ conversations are active simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain separate context for each conversation
3. WHEN 200+ different clients are using the system THEN the system SHALL isolate client contexts and prevent cross-contamination
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens and associate them with the correct client context
5. WHEN invalid requests are received THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes
6. WHEN the service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return proper error responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time streaming responses, so that I can see the response being generated progressively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL support streaming response delivery
2. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN the system SHALL send response chunks as they are generated
3. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to complete response delivery
4. WHEN the connection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the disconnection gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat service to integrate with existing memory and thinking services, so that it leverages the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat service starts THEN it SHALL establish connections to the memory service
2. WHEN sequential thinking is enabled THEN it SHALL connect to the thinking service
3. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN service configurations change THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring restarts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to retrieve and layer relevant memories according to the SYNTH hierarchy, so that responses incorporate the appropriate contextual knowledge from different authority levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving memories THEN the system SHALL query memories at the appropriate hierarchy levels (SYNTH class, company, client)
2. WHEN multiple memory contexts overlap THEN the system SHALL merge them according to hierarchy precedence
3. WHEN memory conflicts exist across hierarchy levels THEN the system SHALL resolve using higher authority precedence
4. WHEN contextual memories are retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain the source hierarchy level for transparency
5. WHEN memory retrieval spans multiple hierarchy levels THEN the system SHALL optimize queries to avoid redundancy

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a memory_maker_crew that can analyze conversations and extract structured memories, so that conversation data can be automatically consolidated into the memory system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory_maker_crew is called THEN it SHALL receive context including client_user_id, actor_type, and actor_id plus conversation data
2. WHEN analyzing conversation data THEN the crew SHALL break it apart into valid entities, observations, and relationships
3. WHEN entities and observations are identified THEN the crew SHALL structure them according to memory API requirements
4. WHEN structured memories are ready THEN the crew SHALL UPSERT them via the memory API tool
5. WHEN memory consolidation fails THEN the crew SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure chat behavior and preferences, so that I can customize the experience to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets preferences THEN the system SHALL store and apply them to future conversations
2. WHEN memory integration is disabled THEN the system SHALL operate without memory access
3. WHEN response length limits are set THEN the system SHALL respect those constraints
4. WHEN invalid configurations are provided THEN the system SHALL use default settings and notify the user
