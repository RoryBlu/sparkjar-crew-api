# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Book Ingestion Crew is a critical component of the SparkJAR system that processes book images from Google Drive, performs OCR on them, and stores the transcribed text in a database with embeddings for search. Currently, the codebase contains multiple versions of the crew implementation with duplicated code, inconsistent error handling, and limited testing. This feature aims to refactor and enhance the Book Ingestion Crew to make it production-ready by consolidating code, improving error handling, enhancing logging, adding comprehensive tests, and ensuring it follows best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Consolidation and Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, consolidated codebase for the Book Ingestion Crew, so that it's easier to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL have a single, consolidated implementation of the Book Ingestion Crew.
2. WHEN reviewing the code structure THEN the system SHALL follow a modular design with clear separation of concerns.
3. WHEN looking at the file organization THEN the system SHALL have a consistent directory structure that follows project standards.
4. WHEN examining imports THEN the system SHALL use proper relative imports that work in both local and deployed environments.
5. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL have removed all duplicate implementations (crew.py, crew_v1.py, crew_simple.py, etc.).
6. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL have a single entry point for both API and local execution.

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want robust error handling in the Book Ingestion Crew, so that failures are gracefully managed and reported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page fails to process THEN the system SHALL continue processing other pages.
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces.
3. WHEN Google Drive access fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry with exponential backoff.
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THEN the system SHALL capture specific error details and provide recovery options.
5. WHEN database storage fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper transaction handling and rollback.
6. WHEN the crew completes THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive summary of successes and failures.

### Requirement 3: Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track the progress and performance of book ingestion jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a book ingestion job starts THEN the system SHALL log job metadata including client ID, book information, and configuration.
2. WHEN a page is processed THEN the system SHALL log progress information with page numbers and confidence scores.
3. WHEN an agent performs an action THEN the system SHALL capture agent interactions in structured logs.
4. WHEN a job completes THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics including processing time and success rates.
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information that can be queried.
6. WHEN examining logs THEN the system SHALL use consistent log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) appropriately.

### Requirement 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests for the Book Ingestion Crew, so that I can verify its functionality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for all core functions with at least 80% code coverage.
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality.
3. WHEN testing with mock data THEN the system SHALL have fixtures that simulate various book formats and error conditions.
4. WHEN testing the crew handler THEN the system SHALL verify proper schema validation and error handling.
5. WHEN testing OCR functionality THEN the system SHALL verify multi-pass OCR improves accuracy.
6. WHEN testing database storage THEN the system SHALL verify proper embedding generation and storage.

### Requirement 5: Input Configuration via Payload

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Book Ingestion Crew to be configurable through the input payload, so that I can control its behavior without changing environment variables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing the crew THEN the system SHALL accept all configuration parameters via the JSON input payload.
2. WHEN processing a book THEN the system SHALL use the language specified in the input payload.
3. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL associate the book with the client context realm specified in the payload.
4. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL NOT require additional environment variables for configuration.
5. WHEN processing a book THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for any parameters not specified in the payload.
6. WHEN examining the payload schema THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation of all supported parameters.

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Usability

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want clear documentation for the Book Ingestion Crew, so that I can understand how it works and how to use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive docstrings for all classes and functions.
2. WHEN looking at the repository THEN the system SHALL have a README with setup and usage instructions.
3. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL include examples of API requests and responses.
4. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL use type hints consistently.
5. WHEN looking at the documentation THEN the system SHALL include a system architecture diagram.
6. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting guides for common issues.

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the Book Ingestion Crew to be performant and scalable, so that it can handle large books and multiple concurrent jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a large book THEN the system SHALL handle pagination efficiently.
2. WHEN multiple jobs are running THEN the system SHALL isolate resources between jobs.
3. WHEN processing pages THEN the system SHALL support parallel processing where appropriate.
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use efficient database operations with proper indexing.
5. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use batched operations for efficiency.
6. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track and report processing time per page.

### Requirement 8: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the Book Ingestion Crew to follow security best practices, so that sensitive data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Google Drive THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods.
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
3. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL avoid logging sensitive information.
4. WHEN processing client data THEN the system SHALL maintain proper isolation between clients.
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL avoid exposing internal system details in error messages.
6. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization.
