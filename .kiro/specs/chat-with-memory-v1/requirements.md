# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chat with Memory v1 feature is a comprehensive chat service that integrates deeply with the SparkJAR Memory Service to provide intelligent, context-aware conversations. The system leverages the 4-realm hierarchical memory architecture (CLIENT, SYNTH, SYNTH_CLASS, SKILL_MODULE) to deliver personalized interactions through two distinct modes: Tutor Mode for active learning experiences and Agent Mode for passive assistance. This chat service acts as the primary interface for users to interact with synths that have access to organizational knowledge, role-based procedures, tool expertise, and personal learning history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to engage in chat conversations with synths that have access to the full 4-realm memory system, so that I receive contextually relevant and organizationally aligned responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a chat session THEN the system SHALL establish connection to the memory service with access to all 4 realms (CLIENT, SYNTH, SYNTH_CLASS, SKILL_MODULE)
2. WHEN the synth responds to queries THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant memories from all accessible realms with proper precedence (CLIENT > SYNTH > SYNTH_CLASS > SKILL_MODULE)
3. WHEN memory conflicts exist across realms THEN the system SHALL apply CLIENT realm precedence over all other memory sources
4. WHEN the synth lacks specific information THEN the system SHALL fall back to LLM general knowledge while maintaining consistency with memory-based information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to use Tutor Mode where the synth actively guides my learning experience, so that I can efficiently acquire knowledge in my desired subject area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tutor Mode is activated THEN the synth SHALL proactively ask the user what they want to learn or know about
2. WHEN the user expresses a learning goal THEN the synth SHALL create a structured learning path from summary to detailed explanations
3. WHEN providing explanations THEN the synth SHALL prioritize information from the 4-realm memory system over general LLM knowledge
4. WHEN the user demonstrates understanding THEN the synth SHALL progressively increase complexity and depth of explanations
5. WHEN the user shows confusion THEN the synth SHALL adapt by simplifying explanations and providing additional context from memory
6. WHEN relevant procedures or SOPs exist in SYNTH_CLASS realm THEN the synth SHALL incorporate these into the learning experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Agent Mode for passive assistance where the synth responds to my specific requests, so that I can get help when needed without unsolicited guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Agent Mode is activated THEN the synth SHALL remain passive until explicitly asked to perform tasks or answer questions
2. WHEN the user makes a request THEN the synth SHALL utilize the 4-realm memory system to provide comprehensive responses
3. WHEN executing tasks THEN the synth SHALL follow procedures from SYNTH_CLASS realm and apply CLIENT realm policies
4. WHEN tool-specific knowledge is needed THEN the synth SHALL access relevant SKILL_MODULE memories
5. WHEN the synth completes a task THEN the system SHALL store the interaction and outcomes in the SYNTH realm for future learning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chat service to maintain conversation history and context across sessions, so that synths can build upon previous interactions and provide continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat session begins THEN the system SHALL load previous conversation history for context continuity
2. WHEN conversations occur THEN the system SHALL store chat messages, responses, and context in the memory service
3. WHEN users reference previous conversations THEN the synth SHALL access stored conversation history from the SYNTH realm
4. WHEN conversation patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL create observations and relationships in the memory system for future optimization
5. WHEN sessions end THEN the system SHALL persist all conversation data with proper metadata for retrieval

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to clearly indicate which mode is active and allow me to switch between modes, so that I can choose the appropriate interaction style for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL display the current mode (Tutor or Agent) prominently
2. WHEN the user wants to switch modes THEN the system SHALL provide a clear mechanism to toggle between Tutor and Agent modes
3. WHEN mode switching occurs THEN the synth SHALL acknowledge the change and adapt its behavior accordingly
4. WHEN in Tutor Mode THEN the interface SHALL indicate the active, learning-focused nature of the interaction
5. WHEN in Agent Mode THEN the interface SHALL indicate the passive, request-response nature of the interaction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat service to integrate seamlessly with the existing memory service API, so that all memory operations follow established patterns and maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat service starts THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the memory service using existing JWT token mechanisms
2. WHEN memory queries are needed THEN the system SHALL use the hierarchical memory manager to access all 4 realms
3. WHEN storing chat data THEN the system SHALL follow the established memory entity and observation patterns
4. WHEN creating relationships THEN the system SHALL link conversations to relevant procedures, knowledge, and outcomes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle memory service failures gracefully with appropriate fallback behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time responses during chat conversations, so that the interaction feels natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL provide typing indicators or loading states
2. WHEN processing complex queries THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates or intermediate responses
3. WHEN memory searches are performed THEN the system SHALL complete searches within 2 seconds for optimal user experience
4. WHEN LLM responses are generated THEN the system SHALL stream responses when possible for immediate feedback
5. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 5 seconds with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all chat interactions to respect organizational access controls and data privacy requirements, so that sensitive information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access chat THEN the system SHALL verify user authentication and authorization for the specific synth
2. WHEN CLIENT realm policies exist THEN the system SHALL enforce data privacy and access restrictions in all responses
3. WHEN sensitive information is requested THEN the system SHALL apply CLIENT realm compliance policies before responding
4. WHEN conversations are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data and apply retention policies
5. WHEN cross-realm access occurs THEN the system SHALL log access patterns for security auditing

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a synth, I want to learn and improve from chat interactions, so that I can provide better assistance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN successful interactions occur THEN the system SHALL store positive patterns and outcomes in the SYNTH realm
2. WHEN users provide feedback THEN the system SHALL create observations linking feedback to specific responses or approaches
3. WHEN repeated questions arise THEN the system SHALL identify patterns and create optimized response templates
4. WHEN new knowledge is acquired THEN the system SHALL store it appropriately in the SYNTH realm for future use
5. WHEN performance metrics are available THEN the system SHALL track conversation quality and user satisfaction indicators

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat service to handle various input types and provide rich response formats, so that I can communicate naturally and receive well-formatted information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users send text messages THEN the system SHALL process natural language input with context understanding
2. WHEN users ask for structured information THEN the system SHALL format responses with appropriate markdown, lists, or tables
3. WHEN procedures or SOPs are referenced THEN the system SHALL present step-by-step information in clear, actionable formats
4. WHEN code or technical content is discussed THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted code blocks and syntax highlighting
5. WHEN users request summaries THEN the system SHALL generate concise overviews while maintaining access to detailed information
