# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive testing framework for the chat API that validates multi-contextual memory integration with Odoo ERP through MCP (Model Context Protocol). The system will support hierarchical actor contexts (synth_class → skill_module → synth → client) where memory is built from multiple sources and tested through interactive chat sessions that can operate in both active tutor and passive agent modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Skill Module Table Creation and Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a skill_modules table that defines contextual dimensions for Odoo-specific knowledge, so that the memory system can store and retrieve skill-based context independently of clients and synths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a skill_modules table with proper schema
2. WHEN skill_modules are stored THEN the system SHALL treat them as an actor_type with corresponding actor_id references
3. WHEN memory is queried THEN the system SHALL support skill_module as a contextual dimension alongside client, synth, and synth_class
4. IF skill_modules are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with existing memory records

### Requirement 2: Odoo Memory Building Script Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a script in the Odoo MCP repo that periodically builds and upserts memory with multi-dimensional contextualization, so that agents in sparkjar-crew have comprehensive Odoo knowledge available when they connect to the MCP server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Odoo MCP repo script runs THEN it SHALL build memory with multi-dimensional contextualization
2. WHEN building memory THEN the script SHALL incorporate skill_modules that are Odoo-specific and context-independent
3. WHEN processing synth_class knowledge THEN the script SHALL include base knowledge and guardrails in memory
4. WHEN memory is built THEN it SHALL support multiple actor contexts (actor_type/actor_id combinations)
5. WHEN system upgrades occur THEN the script SHALL dynamically rebuild memory based on installed ERP version
6. IF memory building fails THEN the script SHALL provide detailed error reporting and recovery options

### Requirement 3: Agent Contextualization for Synth Imitation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want agents in sparkjar-crew to mimic synths whose companies have subscribed to skill_modules, so that the chat API can provide contextually appropriate responses based on multi-dimensional memory contextualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory is queried THEN the system SHALL follow the hierarchy: synth_class → skill_module → synth → client
2. WHEN contexts conflict THEN higher-level contexts SHALL override lower-level ones
3. WHEN skill_module and synth_class contexts exist THEN they SHALL coexist without overriding each other
4. WHEN memory is retrieved THEN the system SHALL merge contexts according to the established hierarchy
5. IF context hierarchy is violated THEN the system SHALL log warnings and apply default precedence rules

### Requirement 4: Chat Interface Development and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a development chat interface that can validate memory functionality and interface with Odoo MCP, so that I can test the complete integration before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface is deployed THEN it SHALL provide a development environment for testing
2. WHEN interfacing with memory THEN the chat SHALL successfully retrieve multi-contextual information
3. WHEN connecting to Odoo MCP THEN the chat SHALL demonstrate proper integration and data flow
4. WHEN testing memory retrieval THEN the chat SHALL validate that all actor contexts are accessible
5. IF the chat interface fails THEN it SHALL provide fallback to direct API endpoint testing

### Requirement 5: Interactive Chat Validation System

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to interactively test chat functionality with properly configured synths that have skill_modules, so that I can validate both active tutor and passive agent modes work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a synth is configured THEN it SHALL have one or more skill_modules assigned as skills
2. WHEN testing active tutor mode THEN the synth SHALL proactively guide users through skill_module patterns
3. WHEN testing passive agent mode THEN the synth SHALL wait for instructions and respond appropriately
4. WHEN utilizing multi-contextual memory THEN the synth SHALL access relevant information from all context levels
5. WHEN acting as tutor THEN the synth SHALL guide clients through manual steps using skill_module knowledge
6. WHEN acting as agent THEN the synth SHALL execute tasks and provide reports using contextual memory
7. IF mode switching is required THEN the synth SHALL transition smoothly between active and passive behaviors

### Requirement 6: Memory Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation that the memory system correctly stores and retrieves information across all contextual dimensions, so that chat interactions are accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory is stored THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity across all actor contexts
2. WHEN memory is retrieved THEN the system SHALL verify correct hierarchical precedence
3. WHEN skill_modules are accessed THEN the system SHALL confirm Odoo-specific knowledge is available
4. WHEN synth_class knowledge is queried THEN the system SHALL include guardrails and base knowledge
5. WHEN testing memory consistency THEN the system SHALL detect and report any data conflicts
6. IF memory validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and repair suggestions

### Requirement 7: Integration Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive testing framework that validates the entire chat API with Odoo MCP integration, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL validate end-to-end functionality from Odoo MCP to chat response
2. WHEN testing memory integration THEN the framework SHALL verify all contextual dimensions are accessible
3. WHEN validating chat responses THEN the system SHALL confirm appropriate use of multi-contextual memory
4. WHEN testing both tutor and agent modes THEN the framework SHALL validate mode-specific behaviors
5. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL meet response time requirements for chat interactions
6. IF integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and remediation steps
