# OCR Quality Improvement Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented multi-pass OCR processing with quality improvements for Castor Gonzalez's handwritten Spanish manuscripts.

## Results Summary

### Initial PaddleOCR Performance
- **Page 1**: 38 words captured
- **Page 2**: 55 words captured  
- **Page 3**: 37 words captured
- **Total**: 130 words (with significant errors)

### Improved Multi-Pass OCR Performance
- **Page 1**: 49 words (combined preprocessing method)
- **Page 2**: 82 words (combined preprocessing method)
- **Page 3**: 35 words (original image worked best)
- **Total**: 166 words (+27.7% improvement)

### Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Multi-Pass Processing**
   - Tested 5 different preprocessing methods per page
   - Methods: original, enhance_contrast, sharpen, brightness, combined
   - Automatically selected best result based on word count and confidence

2. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Contrast enhancement (1.5x to 2.0x)
   - Sharpness enhancement 
   - Brightness adjustment (1.3x)
   - Combined enhancements for optimal results

3. **Post-Processing with LLM**
   - Used OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to correct OCR errors
   - Fixed word boundaries and added Spanish accents
   - Maintained original meaning while improving readability

## Technical Details

### Best Preprocessing Methods by Page
- **Page 1**: Combined (contrast + sharpness) - 49 words
- **Page 2**: Combined (contrast + sharpness) - 82 words  
- **Page 3**: Original (no preprocessing) - 35 words

### Confidence Scores
- Average confidence: 0.74-0.80
- Highest confidence: Page 3 (0.80)
- Lowest confidence: Page 2 (0.73)

## Files Created
1. `castor_ocr_tool_results.txt` - Basic OCR results
2. `castor_simple_improved_final.txt` - Multi-pass improved results
3. Both files uploaded to Google Drive successfully

## Limitations Still Present
- PaddleOCR struggles with cursive Spanish handwriting
- Some words still incorrectly segmented
- Total capture rate still below 50% of actual content
- Would benefit from fine-tuning on Spanish handwriting dataset

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Consider training custom model on Spanish cursive handwriting
2. Implement ensemble approach with multiple OCR engines
3. Add dictionary-based post-processing for Spanish
4. Explore specialized handwriting recognition models
